=====================================================

(all the command after '*' need to be prompted into the vscode terminal)

1. Clone the Home Assistant Core Repository

    Purpose: Clones the Home Assistant core repository to your local machine.

        * git clone https://github.com/home-assistant/core.git
        * cd core

2. Create the Configuration Directory

    Purpose: Creates a config directory for Home Assistant configuration files.

3. Build the Docker Image

    Purpose: Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile.dev file.
    
        * docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t homeassistant-dev .

4. Start the Docker Container

    Purpose: Runs the Docker container with the Home Assistant image and mounts your local directory.
    Note: replace the '$(pwd)' with your core file directory if there is an error with the provided command.

        * docker run -it --name homeassistant-dev -v "$(pwd):/workspaces" -p 8123:8123 homeassistant-dev

5. Access Home Assistant

    Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8123.

6. Making Live Code Changes (Two Methods)

    Method 1: Manual Restart

        a. After making code changes, restart the container:

            * docker restart homeassistant-dev

    Method 2: Attach VS Code to the Docker Container

        a. Open VS Code, go to the Remote Explorer.
        b. Attach to the homeassistant-dev container.
        c. Activate the virtual environment:

            * source /home/vscode/.local/ha-venv/bin/activate

        d. Start Home Assistant:

            * python3 -m homeassistant --config /workspaces/config

7. Stop the Docker Container

    Purpose: Stops the running Docker container.
